Tools for cross-compilation to `x86_64-elf`.

Includes the formulae `x86_64-elf-{binutils,gcc}`, which are analogous to
i386-elf-binutils and i386-elf-gcc but for the x86\_64 architecture.

You can install these by simply running

```
brew install tchajed/x86_64-tools/x86_64-elf-{binutils,gcc}
```

which will add this tap and install both formulae.
